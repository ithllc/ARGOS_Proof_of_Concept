# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and productive community, all contributors, maintainers, and users of the Mini-ARGOS project agree to abide by this Code of Conduct.

We welcome people of all backgrounds and identities and expect everyone to be treated with respect. Harassment, hateful conduct, and other abusive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces including GitHub issues, pull requests, code reviews, mailing lists, chat channels, and any events or places where contributors represent the project.

## Standards

All participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and considerate in language and actions.
- Focus criticism on the work, not the individual.
- Avoid discriminatory or harassing language or behavior.
- Follow all applicable laws and the terms of any platform being used.

## Prohibited Uses of Generative Media and Content

To reduce harm and misuse, contributors and users must not use this project's code, datasets, or any derived tools to create or publish generated images, video, or audio that:

- Depict historical figures (public or private) in fabricated or compromising sexual, criminal, or other degrading situations that are contrary to the historical record, with the intent to mislead or defame.
- Are designed to disparage, humiliate, or ruin the reputation of a person or group.
- Are intended to impersonate real individuals in a way that would cause harm, deception, or significant emotional distress.

If your work produces or could be used to produce media matching the descriptions above, you must not publish such outputs and must take reasonable steps to prevent misuse (for example: watermarking, disclaimers, restricting access, or removing offending outputs).

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it by contacting the project maintainers:

- Primary contact: Frank Ivey <frankivey@bigdataandopensource.onmicrosoft.com>

Reports will be handled promptly and with discretion. The maintainers will review the report, may ask for additional information, and will take action as appropriate, which may include warnings, revoking contributor privileges, removing content, or involving platform or legal authorities if necessary.

## Licensing and Contributions

Contributions are accepted under the project's license (GNU AGPL). By contributing, you agree to license your contributions under the same terms unless a different arrangement is made in writing.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct draws on common open-source community practices and is intended to be practical and enforceable. If you have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or contact the project maintainers.
